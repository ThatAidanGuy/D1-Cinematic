This is my submission for D1-Cinematic.

Includes:
- 3+ distinct visual scenes! (Intro, Transition, Title Screen)
- 2+ audio assets! (Voice over and audio effect, both very clearly created by me)
- 2+ image assets! (The flyer character, the company logo and the speech bubble!)
- 2+ geometric shapes! (Yellow and white circles and blue and black rectangles)
- 1+ big fancy text! (The GREEDY SKIES logo)
- 1+ multi-line text! (The text of the speech bubble, and there are several separate single-line texts for the menu options)
- 1+ fading scene transition! (The last scene fades to black, the rest transition smoothly into one another)
- 1+ object motion animation! (Many, many objects fly across or into the screen!)

So what are you waiting for, come on down and see ... what's probably a pretty normal, but still cool, submission for a basic school project!
